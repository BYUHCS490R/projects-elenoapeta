    <p>I really like <strong>technology</strong> and fixing electronics like computers, phones, and speakers. 
        Working on devices is fun because I get to solve problems and help people at the same time. 
        I even offer a small repair service for students, which makes me feel proud and motivated.
        </p>
    <p>I also love <em>languages and culture</em>. I can speak English, Tongan, and Bislama, which makes it 
        easy to talk to people from different backgrounds. I like music and sports too because they 
        keep me <mark>active and creative</mark> Doing these things helps me stay balanced and focused on what I want to do.
    </p>

    <p>My personal motto is simple: always keep learning &amp; never stop trying. 
        I think being kind and passionate matters more than money &hearts;. 
        Staying humble and focused has helped me in school and in life.
