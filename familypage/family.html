          <h3>BYU Hawaii</h3>
          <p>Three of us are studying here at Brigham Young University–Hawaii.

            sister and I are still here continuing our education. We are grateful
            for this opportunity to learn, grow, and prepare for our future.</p>

        <h3>Our Family of Ten</h3>
        <p>Our family has ten members five girls and five boys. 
          Eight of us have already served a mission, and the ninth
          will finish his mission this coming November. The youngest 
          in our family is still waiting for his mission call. 
          Serving the Lord has always been our family’s promise 
          to our parents, and it is one of our greatest goals 
          in life.</p>

        <h3>Global Mission Service</h3>
        <p>We all served our missions in different countries around the world.
          Four of us served in our homeland, Tonga, one in Vanuatu, two in New 
          Zealand, one in the Philippines, and one in Australia. Even though
          we were far from each other, our purpose was the same—to serve the 
          Lord and help others come unto Christ.</p>

        <h3>Faith and Future</h3>
        <p>One of my biggest goals after finishing school is to marry in the temple.
           I believe that temple marriage will bring eternal happiness and blessings 
           to my future family. This goal keeps me focused on my faith and education
           every day.</p>
