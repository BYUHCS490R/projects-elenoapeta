        <figcaption>Our Family of Ten</figcaption>
        <p>Our family has ten members—five girls and five boys. 
            Eight of us have already served a mission, and the 
            ninth will finish his mission this coming November.
            The youngest in our family is still waiting for his 
            mission call. Serving the Lord has always been our
            family’s promise to our parents, and it is one of our 
            greatest goals in life.</p>

        <figcaption>Mission Service</figcaption>
        <p>We all served our missions in different countries around the 
            world. Four of us served in our homeland, Tonga, one in 
            Vanuatu, two in New Zealand, one in the Philippines, and one
            in Australia. Even though we were far from each other, our
            purpose was the same—to serve the Lord and help others 
            come unto Christ.</p>

        <figcaption>Education at BYU–Hawaii</figcaption>
        <p>Three of us are studying here at Brigham Young University–Hawaii. 
            Our oldest sister graduated from BYU–Hawaii in 2010, and my other 
            sister and I are still here continuing our education. We are 
            grateful for this opportunity to learn, grow, and prepare for our
            future.</p>
