          My biggest interests is Volleyball. I enjoy watching 
          and playing it because its makes me feel that I enjoying playing 
          in teamwork, and athletic skills. The fast pace and 
          excitement of the game is always motivate me to stay active and practice
          my skills. I also love the way of volleyball can bring 
          the people together, whether on a local 
          court or professional arenas around the world.

           I find it admirable how focused and disciplined a successful 
           basketball player must be. On and off the court, it has taught me 
           leadership and collaboration. Every game has a backstory, and I find it
           motivational to see how players triumph obstercles and modify their
           tactics in real time.

            An <strong>absolute link</strong> is a link that points to a full address outside
